CWATM - Community Water Model  1.4  Date:  2022/01/12 17:27  
International Institute of Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA)
Running under platform:  Windows
-----------------------------------------------------------
Resolution of meteo forcing is 12 times higher than base maps.

=> ModFlow is used


=> ModFlow timestep is :  1  days

=> Topography is used as upper limit of groundwater. Correcting depth under lakes. It can make ModFlow difficulties to converge
=> Initial water table depth is uploaded from  C:\Data\bhima_Input_mainCWatM\Modflow\modflow_inputs\modflow_watertable_totalend.nc
=> Potential groundwater inflow from rivers is  0.05  m/day
=> Groundwater inflow from lakes/reservoirs is  0.05  m/day
=> Groundwater pumping should be deactivated if includeWaterDemand is False
=> THE PUMPING MAP SHOULD BE DEFINED (In transient.py ALSO LINE 420) BEFORE TO RUN THE MODEL AND BE THE SAME FOR ALL THE SIMULATION
=> Pumping in the ModFlow layer is prevented if water table is under  0.7  of the layer capacity

=> ModFlow-CwatM water balance is checked
ModFlow discrepancy for each time step can be extracted from the listing file (.lst file) at the end of the simulation,
as well as the actual pumping rate applied in ModFlow (ModFlow automatically reduces the pumping rate once the ModFlow cell is almost saturated)
=> Soil moisture is filled at  75.0  % at the begining
Sector- and source-specific abstraction fractions are activated
