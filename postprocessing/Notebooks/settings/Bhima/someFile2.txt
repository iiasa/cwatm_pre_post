CWATM - Community Water Model  1.4  Date:  2022/01/12 17:27

Running under platform:  Windows
-----------------------------------------------------------
Resolution of meteo forcing is 12 times higher than base maps.

=> ModFlow is used


=> ModFlow timestep is :  1  days

=> Topography is used as upper limit of groundwater. Correcting depth under lakes. It can make ModFlow difficulties to converge
=> Initial water table depth is uploaded from  C:\Data\bhima_Input_mainCWatM\Modflow\modflow_inputs\modflow_watertable_totalend.nc
=> Potential groundwater inflow from rivers is  0.05  m/day
=> Groundwater inflow from lakes/reservoirs is  0.05  m/day
=> Groundwater pumping should be deactivated if includeWaterDemand is False
=> THE PUMPING MAP SHOULD BE DEFINED (In transient.py ALSO LINE 420) BEFORE TO RUN THE MODEL AND BE THE SAME FOR ALL THE SIMULATION
=> Pumping in the ModFlow layer is prevented if water table is under  0.7  of the layer capacity
